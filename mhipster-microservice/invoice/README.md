This application was generated with [MHipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut), a [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) blueprint for [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech)!
You can find documentation and help at [https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut).

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, run:

    ./gradlew

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build a jar, run:

    ./gradlew clean jar

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.jar

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ../gradlew clean assemble dockerBuild -Pprod

    Gradle uses official [micronaut-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin) for Docker image generation.

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.
